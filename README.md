# Dragbase

Dragbase is a library, written in C, which adds enhanced drag-and-drop functionality to your Windows software - independently of the programming language your software is written in. It takes a few minutes to integrate Dragbase into your software. With dragbase, users can drag-and-drop the currently opened file to any other application. For instance, the file, respectively the icon, could be dropped in the Windows Explorer to a certain directory and the file would be saved in this directory. Or the file could be dropped in Microsoft Outlook and then a new email would be created with the file as attachment.
